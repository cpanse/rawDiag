Description: Optimizing methods for liquid chromatography coupled to mass
  spectrometry (LCâ€“MS) poses a nontrivial challenge. The rawDiag package
  facilitates rational method optimization by generating MS operator-tailored
  diagnostic plots of scan-level metadata. The package is designed for use on
  the R shell or as a Shiny application on the Orbitrap instrument PC.
